Static plots can be difficult to process as a viewer and difficult to explain as a presenter. One technique to work with busy plots may be to embed transitions into them to help walk through them during oral presentations. Weâ€™ll walk through some *gganimate* transitions that may be helpful for walking through figures. 

## Load in dataset + relevant libraries
In all these examples, we will use the penguins dataset in the *palmerpenguins* package. Instructions to download this package can be found [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). This package includes two datasets but we will use penguins. Before using this data in figures, we omitted any rows with one or more cells using the na.omit() function. Additionally, we will be loading in the following packages: *ggplot2*, *RcolorBrewer*, and *gganimate*.

```{r dataset, warning=F}
library(palmerpenguins)

?penguins #can be used to find more information about the penguins dataset

data("penguins")
head(penguins)
penguins <- na.omit(penguins)  #remove any rows with missing values

library(ggplot2) # to create data visualizations 
library(RcolorBrewer) # for multiple color palettes
library(gganimate) # to add animations to visualizations
```
## Continuous variable? 
The *transition_reveal()* function reveals each new frame of a dimension gradually. Usually, this dimension is a continuous variable or a time series. The *transition_time()* function can be used for continuous variables or where the variables are representing specific points in time. In both of these functions, you can specify the range of the variable using the *"range="* argument of these functions. 

### transition_reveal
Static plot:
```{r}
linestatic <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=sex))+
  geom_line(show.legend=F)+
  geom_point(show.legend=F)+ 
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x="Bill Length (mm)", y= "Flipper Length (mm)", # label axes
       title="Bill and Flipper Length by Sex") # label figure
linestatic # view graph 
```
{{< figure library="true" src="linestatic.png" >}}

Animated plot:
```{r}
lineanim <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=sex))+
  geom_line(show.legend=F)+
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x="Bill Length (mm)", y= "Flipper Length (mm)", # label axes
       title="Bill and Flipper Length by Sex")+ # label figure 
  transition_reveal(bill_length_mm) #gganimate part; continuous variable 
lineanim # view animated graph
```
{{< figure library="true" src="lineanim.gif" >}}

### transition_time 
Static plot:
```{r}
bubstatic <- ggplot(penguins, aes(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm, 
                                colour = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.7, show.legend = F) + # alpha = opacity of points 
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")+ 
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x="Body Mass (g)", y="Flipper Length (mm)", # label axes
       title="Body Mass and Flipper Length by Species and Bill Length") # label figure
bubstatic # view static plot 
```
{{< figure library="true" src="bubstatic.png" >}}

Animated Plot:
```{r}
bubanim <- ggplot(penguins, aes(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm, 
                     colour = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = F) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")+
  theme_classic()+
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', # label each frame of the animation 
       x = 'Body Mass (g)', y = 'Flipper Length (mm)') + # label axes
  transition_time(year) + # gganimate part; continuous time variable 
  ease_aes('linear') # adjusts the speed of the asethetic; smooths the animation out 
bubanim # view animated plot
```
{{< figure library="true" src="bubanim.gif" >}}

## Discrete variable?
The *transition_states()* function animates the states of a discrete variable.

### transition_states
#### Example 1
Static Plot:
```{r}
pointstatic <- ggplot(penguins, 
                  aes(x=body_mass_g, 
                      y= flipper_length_mm))+
  geom_point(aes(color=species),
             position="jitter", show.legend = F)+
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x="Body Mass (g)", y="Flipper Length (mm)",
       title="Body Mass and Flipped Length by Penguin Species")
pointstatic # view static plot
```
{{< figure library="true" src="pointstatic.png" >}}

Animated Plot:
```{r}
pointanim <- ggplot(penguins, 
          aes(x=body_mass_g, 
              y= flipper_length_mm))+
  geom_point(aes(color=species, group=1L), # choose the discrete variable aesthetic; the group= argument fades each group value into each other
             position="jitter", show.legend = F)+ 
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x="Body Mass (g)", y="Flipper Length (mm)", # label axes
       title="Body Mass and Flipped Length by Penguin Species")+
  #gganimate part     
  transition_states(species, # discrete variable
                    transition_length = 2, # length of transition between discrete variable groups
                    state_length = 1)+ # duration of animation on each group of the discrete variable
  ggtitle('Now showing {closest_state}',
          subtitle = 'Frame {frame} of {nframes}') # label each frame of the animation 
pointanim # view anim plot 
```
{{< figure library="true" src="pointanim.gif" >}}

#### Example 2
These transitions can be useful for going through even simpler graphs like this example. 

Static Plot:
```{r}
boxstatic <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g, color=sex))+
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = F)+
  theme_clean()+
  labs(x="Penguin Species", y="Body Mass (g)", # label the axes
       title = "Body Mass by Species and Sex") # label the title 
boxstatic # view static plot 
```
{{< figure library="true" src="boxstatic.png" >}}

Animated Plot:
```{r}
boxanim<- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y =body_mass_g,color=sex))+
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = F)+
  theme_clean()+
  labs(x="Penguin Species", y="Body Mass (g)", # label axes
       title = "Body Mass by Species and Sex")+ #label title 
  transition_states(species, # discrete variable
                    transition_length = 2, # length of transition between discrete variable groups
                    state_length = 1)+ # duration of animation on each group of the discrete variable
  exit_shrink() + # modifys aesthetics of disappearing data
  ease_aes('sine-in-out') # adjusts the speed of the asethetic; smooths the animation out 
boxanim # view animated plot 
```
{{< figure library="true" src="boxanim.gif" >}}
